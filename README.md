# Burger-App

view deployment here: https://safe-headland-37929.herokuapp.com/

In this application I've used Sequelize to manage an SQL database storing values relating to the burgers displayed. <br>
As you interact with the page, you're using CRUD methodology, Creating new burgers, Reading stored data, Updating if they've been eaten, and deleting by throwing away the leftovers.
